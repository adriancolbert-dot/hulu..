    <p>Hulu is a streaming service that offers a vast library of TV shows, movies, and original content. It operates on a subscription-based model, where users can access content either through an ad-supported plan or an ad-free plan, depending on their preference. Hulu works by licensing content from various networks and studios, providing users with next-day access to current TV episodes, along with a selection of older shows, films, and exclusive original series. Additionally, Hulu offers the ability to stream live TV, including news, sports, and more, through its Hulu + Live TV service. The platform is accessible via internet-connected devices, including smartphones, smart TVs, tablets, and computers, giving users flexibility in how they consume content. With personalized recommendations based on viewing history and preferences, Hulu aims to create a tailored streaming experience for its subscribers.</p>
